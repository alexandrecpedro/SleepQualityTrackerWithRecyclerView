## SleepQualityTracker with RecyclerView

The SleepQualityTracker app is a demo app that helps you collect information about your sleep.
This app builds on the SleepQualityTracker previous made 
(https://github.com/alexandrecpedro/SleepQualityTracker), refactoring the code to make it 
more efficient so it will be easier to maintain and test. 

It displays a list of results in a RecyclerView instead of a static ScrollView.
